CloudProxy v1.5

This project depends on several third-party libraries, which are
installed in third_party: keyczar, protobuf, google-glog, gflags,
ninja, and gyp. The openssl development libraries must also be
installed. On Ubuntu, this can be accomplished with the command

> sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

To build CloudProxy, you must first build ninja and set up ninja build
files using gyp. Let SRC be the directory that contains this README
file. Then the build configuration can be accomplished with the
command:

> cd $SRC
> ${SRC}/build/bootstrap.sh.

The C++ sources in $SRC are formatted in accordance with Google style
guidelines. One easy way to make any changes match this format is to
use clang-format; a version built for x86-64 linux is checked in to
${ROOT}/bin/clang-format. The following command will reformat file.cc
in place:

> ${ROOT}/bin/clang-format --style=Google -i file.cc
