CloudProxy v1.5

This project depends on several third-party libraries, which are
installed in third_party: keyczar, protobuf, google-glog, gflags,
ninja, and gyp. The openssl and TSPI development libraries must also be
installed. On Ubuntu, this can be accomplished with the command

> sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libtspi-dev

To build CloudProxy, you must first build ninja and set up ninja build
files using gyp. Let SRC be the directory that contains this README
file. Then the build configuration can be accomplished with the
command:

> cd $SRC
> ${SRC}/build/bootstrap.sh.

To update the build after any change to a .gyp file, call gyp from the src
directory. To get this to work, you have to have gyp in your path: 

> cd $SRC
> export PATH=${PATH}:`pwd`/third_party/gyp

Then in the $SRC directory, you can call gyp to fix up the build files

> GYP_GENERATORS=ninja gyp build/all.gyp --toplevel-dir=`pwd`

And if you have ninja in your path, then you can build directly from the $SRC
directory.

> ninja -C out/Default

The C++ sources in $SRC are formatted in accordance with Google style
guidelines. One easy way to make any changes match this format is to
use clang-format; a version built for x86-64 linux is checked in to
${ROOT}/bin/clang-format. The following command will reformat file.cc
in place:

> ${ROOT}/bin/clang-format --style=Google -i file.cc

Note, however, that clang-format does not rename anything to match the naming
conventions. Please see the files themselves for these conventions.
