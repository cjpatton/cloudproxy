Use, duplication and disclosure of the tcioDD device driver consisting of 
tcioDD.c and the support files in this directory required to compile   
tcioDD.c (hereinafter "TCIODD") is different from the license terms that
apply to the other software in the CloudProxy Project.  TCIODD is licensed
under terms which  are generally described as a dual BSD/GPL license.

TCIODD is licensed either under the terms of the Lesser GNU Lesser General 
Public License,  version 2.1, set forth in the file "gpl.txt" of this 
directory or the BSD license, set forth in the file "BSDLicense.pdf."  Note,
however, that if the symbol "LINUX" is defined during compilation, the
resulting loadable object module is subject to the Lesser GNU Lesser General 
Public License,  version 2.1 since it is combined with functionality that is 
only available to GPL licensed software.

These license terms do not affect the license terms of other software or 
documentation provided with CloudProxy.
