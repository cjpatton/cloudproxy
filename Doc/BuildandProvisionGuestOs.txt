Building and provisioning the Guest OS
======================================


1. Install via virt-manager a fresh VM from a CD.
    My password is Tori.

2. Download the development tools, source and 
   BuildingTrustedOS.txt and kvm.txt.

3. SSH the jlmcrypt directory into the VM.
    apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo service ssh start
    sudo stop ssh
    sudo start ssh
    sudo restart ssh
    sudo status ssh
    ssh jlm@192.168.122.244
    sftp
    put jlmcrypt.tar .

4. Save the VM Image in virtmanager.
   You can find the IP address to SSH to by going into the VM
   and typing idconfig -a.
