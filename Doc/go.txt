Let ROOT be the root of the CloudProxy source tree

> cd ${ROOT}/go/src/cloudproxy/tao
> go build
> go test

Now, just for extra information about Go style and such: 

- golint will check for obvious style violations. You can get it by running

go get github.com/golang/lint/golint

Then run golint file.go

- go vet will check for correctness issues. You can get it by running

go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet

Then run go vet file.go

- go test -coverprofile=c.out  will generate test coverage stats. You can get the cover tool by running 

go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/cover

To see a nice HTML representation of test coverage (I don't think ours is great at the moment), run

go tool cover -html=c.out

after running the test command.

- The standard conventions of Go are covered very nicely in the article Effective Go:

http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

- standard code review comments/problems are covered in https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments
