Instructions for taking ownership of the TPM
============================================


install trousers
sudo agt-get install trousers
sudo agt-get install tpm-dev
sudo agt-get install tpm-tools
sudo agt-get install libtspi-dev

make sure TXT and vt-d is enabled too

you may have to remove power to reset TPM
may have to 
    tpm_createek
must set ownerauth


After enabling the TPM in BIOS, type:
    Note: if someone has already taken ownership, you must disable the tpm and 
          reenable it
    sudo bash
    tscd start
    tpm_takeownership -z
    tpm_getpubek

you need to compile a tool to make an AIK key
cd TPMUser
Set your object paths and make the object directories
    mkdir ~/jlmcrypt
    mkdir ~/jlmcrypt/vTCIobjects
make -f vTCI.mak
    vTCI.exe -initAIK 

This command puts the generated AIK Blob file in the subdirectory ./HW/aikblob.
The location of the aikblob file can be changed with flags (call vTCI.exe -help
to find out how).  This blob file will be needed later.
