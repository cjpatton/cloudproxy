Instructions for testing fileProxy on a development machine
===========================================================


After keys are initialized for fileProxy and fileClient, perform the
following operations as superuser

1. stop tcsd if started

  /etc/init.d/trousers stop 

2. make sure you have access to the tpm device. 

  chown <username> /dev/tpm0

you will have to log out and back in to get the right group permissions.

3. create the tcioDD0 device

  cd /dev
  mknod tcioDD0 c 100 0
  chmod 0777 /dev/tcioDD0

4. add tcioDD to the kernel  
  cd ~/jlmcrypt
  insmod tcioDD.ko

Regular user
./tcService.exe &
sleep 2s
./fileServer.exe -initProg
sleep 2s
./fileClient.exe -initProg
