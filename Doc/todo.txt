Todo
====

Enable measure hashes and add to KeyNegoServer db  
Enable 2048 bit keys, 
Check timing attack.
Check for leaks buffer overflows
Measurement race when starting app/vm
VM identity code, check and make robust
tcService hang after init

keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update
Centralized keyNegoServer

tcService
    Fix hard coded template in kvmstartvm

replace hardcoded path in tcLaunch with designated temp area
fix pid hack


KVM:
    Improve cross vm comms perf (device drivers)
    initram for kvm
    Disable any functions-migrate, etc
    Make sure boot loader is the os element in image.
    Make sure image measured is image booted (and check race)
    Disable save state for OS
    Minimize Linux and configure policy

KVM Guest:
   Minimize Linux
   Network save of key files, etc.

Hypervisor
    Management partition
        schedule, start vm's, montoring, update
    VM update and keys

Not required (if configuration is perfect and initram is measured) but disireable:
measure tcService.
