Enable 2048 bit keys (jlm)                                      (3)
Check for leaks buffer overflows (jlm, c-lang/valgrind)         (3)
Measurement race when starting app/vm (tom?)                    (2)
    Fix pid hack (jlm, tom/rekha to ask kvm guys)               (3?)
Check on locality for tpm (jlm)                                 (1)
Check timing attack (jlm, help from google/intel)               (3)
AIK in persistent memory?
tcService hang after init (jlm started - low priority)
Rewrite kvmtciodd/ktciodd channel (tom)

Make sure PCR18 is included in measurement for production use!

keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update (later)

KVM Host:
    initram for kvm (rekha)
    Minimize Linux and configure policy (rekha)
    Disable any functions-migrate, etc (tom to check with kvm guys)
    Disable save state for OS (tom to check with kvm guys)

KVM Guest Partitions:
    Minimize Linux (rekha)

Network save of key files, etc. (Later)

Hypervisor
    Management partition (jlm will do initial version, check openstack)
        schedule, start vm's, montoring, update
    VM update and keys (later)

Not required (if configuration is perfect and initram is measured) 
but disireable: measure tcService.
