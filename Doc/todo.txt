Todo

1. Measure hashes and add to KeyNegoServer db

2. Fix vTCI to handle TPM owner password

3. Check on filelock in tcService

4. Static kernel (see notes)

5. Construct Initramfs
    Copy tcService, FileClient, FileProxy and dynamic link libraries to intiramfs.
    Rewrite init
    include dmcrypt and turn on swap space encrypt
    add tcioDD, tpm, dmcrypt

6. PCR18 (19 too if lcp is set)

7. Collect zombies

8. Close file descriptors for dead clients

9. keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update

10.Hypervisor

11.Management partition

12.VM update and keys

13.Group keys

14.Fix up certificates

15.Crypto: 2048 bit keys, ECC, CBC encrypt and mac (rather than mac then encrypt),
           SHA-3, GCM, spped up RSA (CRT)

16.Check for leaks buffer overflows


--------------------------------------------

1. there are no instructions in OperatingKeyNegoServer

2. the tcioDD instructions are incomplete
  - they don't say how to set up the makefile (e.g., to find the
current linux headers)
  - they don't gives the steps to build tcioDD
