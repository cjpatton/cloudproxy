Enable 2048 bit keys (jlm)
Check timing attack (jlm, help from google/intel)
Check for leaks buffer overflows (jlm c-lang/valgrind)
Measurement race when starting app/vm (tom?)
tcService hang after init (jlm started - low priority)
Rewrite kvmtciodd/ktciodd channel (tom)
Check on locality for tpm (jlm)

keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update (later)
Centralized keyNegoServer (jlm)


KVM Host:
    initram for kvm (rekha?)
    Disable any functions-migrate, etc (tom to check with kvm guys)
    Disable save state for OS (tom to check with kvm guys)
    Minimize Linux and configure policy (rekha?)
    Fix pid hack (jlm, tom/rekha to ask kvm guys)

KVM Guest Partitions:
    Minimize Linux (rekha?)
    Network save of key files, etc. (later)

Hypervisor
    Management partition (jlm will do initial version, check openstack)
        schedule, start vm's, montoring, update
    VM update and keys (later)

Not required (if configuration is perfect and initram is measured) but disireable:
measure tcService.
