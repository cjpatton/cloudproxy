====

Enable measure hashes and add to KeyNegoServer db  
Enable 2048 bit keys, 
Check timing attack.
Check for leaks buffer overflows
Measurement race when starting app/vm
VM identity code, check and make robust
tcService hang after init

keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update
Centralized keyNegoServer


KVM:
    Improve cross vm comms perf
    initram for kvm
    Disable any functions-migrate, etc
    Make sure boot loader is the os element in image.
    Make sure image measured is image booted (and check race)
    Disable save state for OS

   Minimize Linux
   Network save of key files, etc.

Hypervisor
