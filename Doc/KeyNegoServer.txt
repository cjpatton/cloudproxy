Instructions for building KeyNegoServer
=======================================


Create the directory for the keyNegoServer objects as described
in DirectoryStructure.txt.
    cd ROOT/keyNegoServer
Edit the keyNegoServer.mak to reflect the correct ROOT directory,
in the distribution, this is called ~/jlmcrypt.  Then
compile keyNegoServer:
    make -f keyNegoServer.mak
If the HASHESDEFINED symbol is defined during compilation, keyNegoServer will
check for authorized hashes.  A sample file defining the hashes is in
Code/(new)cryptUtility/samples/validHash.txt.
