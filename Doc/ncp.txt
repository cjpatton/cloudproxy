Network Control Program
=======================

The network control program starts authoried partitions in
the Linux KVM Host and manages authorization on behalf of
the KVM Host.  It is currently a very simple program (included
in the KVM Host's initramfs file along with a script that starts 
it [later]).

Later it will interact with the data center fabric controller to
schedule VMs to run on the KVM host and manage the inter-VM
permissions.
