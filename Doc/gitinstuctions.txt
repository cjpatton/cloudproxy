Using the Git Repository
========================

The repository access paths are:
    https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/git/users/manfer/fileProxyPapers.git
    https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/git/users/manfer/fileProxy.git

git push -u origin master


Getting the certificates

Linux:
wget https://cert.incommon.org/InCommonServerCA.crt
openssl x509 -inform DER -in InCommonServerCA.crt -out incommon.pem
sudo su
cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.bak
cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.bak incommon.pem >
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
exit

However, this means that you need to enter your username and password
each time you want to do a remote operation, so I prefer the SSH
version, since I can use ssh-agent to keep track of my key.
