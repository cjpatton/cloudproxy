If you want to be able to debug a Linux kernel that’s running as 
a KVM guest, you need to specify the ‘-s’ parameter for the command 
line of qemu-kvm. The problem is, there’s no (easy) way to do this 
when you’re using libvirt and virt-manager to manager your virtual 
machines, instead of using KVM directly. What you need to do is 
change the XML configuration of the virtual machine so that the 
‘-s’ parameter is passed on to qemu-kvm


$ virsh edit f14-test

Here, f14-test is the name of the VM that is managed via virt-manager. 
This will bring up the XML configuration of the VM in your editor. 
The first line of the XML file should be:

<domain type='kvm'>

This has to be changed to

<domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>

and you also need to add:

<qemu:commandline>
<qemu:arg value='-s'/>
</qemu:commandline>

under the <domain> level of the XML. After you save and quit the editor, 
the new configuration will come into effect. When you start the virtual 
machine, there will be a local TCP port (1234 by default) that can be 
used as a remote debugging port from gdb. You can connect to this port 
by using the command

target remote localhost:1234

from gdb running on the host machine.

gdb /usr/src/linux...  (guest build area)
