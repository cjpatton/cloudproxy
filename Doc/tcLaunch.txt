Starting measured programs
==========================

tcLaunch starts measured programs (including hypervisors) from the
command line.  It replaces the old -initProg hack that was used to
start measured versions of fileClient and fileServer, for example,
in version one.   tcLaunch exits after the measured program is 
started.  tcLaunch currently takes a flag and a single argument which 
names the image (executable or guest VM) to be started but it can
easily be extended to take additional arguments.  Here are three
examples:

    ./tcLaunch.exe -LinuxHost  ./fileClient.exe
This starts fileClient.exe as a measured program in a Linux system serving
as the primary (base) host.

    ./tcLaunch.exe -KVMHost ../vm/fileClientPartition.img
This starts a virtual machine from fileClientPartition.img as a measured 
guest in a KVM system serving as the primary (base) host.

    ./tcLaunch.exe -KVMGuest ./fileClient.exe
This starts fileClient.exe as a measured program in a Linux guest system
running as a guest over a KVM host.
