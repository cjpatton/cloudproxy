Instructions for signing and installing TPM keys
================================================

This step used the aikblob and the aik-hex-file generated in step 5.

Generate a public/private key pair (the "activity policy key").

Create the directory that tcService will find the hardware keys and
certificates, called the hardware store directory (By default this is: ).
Copy the aikblob into the hardware store directory.

In the executable directory type:
    ./cryptUtility.exe -GenKey RSA1024 private-key-file
Store the private-key-file in .

Produce the AIK certificate by typing:
    ./cryptUtility.exe -SignHexModulus private-key-file aik-hex-file cert-file
The aik-hex-file is in HW/aikKeyFile.txt if you did not change the
        defaults in step 5.
Store the cert-file in .

Produce the include file that will be used to insert the policy cert in the
activity elements.
    ./cryptUtility.exe -PolicyCert cert-file output-include-file programname
Copy the output-include-file to XXX.
