The cpvmm source is moving to CMake for its build system. All the makefiles have
been removed and replaced with CMakeLists.txt. This allows you to build
out-of-tree and to have multiple simultaneous build configurations in different
directories. It also allows you to use Ninja or Makefiles or other build
systems, as needed. The current configuration has only been tested with gcc, and
it only seems to work in the Release configuration, though this seems to be a
problem with the original Makefile version, as well.

To build cpvmm, start in directory above cpvmm: 

> mkdir cpvmm_build
> cd cpvmm_build
> cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../cpvmm
> ninja
> sudo cp vmm/evmm.bin /boot
> sudo cp vmm/bootstrap/bootstrap.bin /boot
> sudo reboot
