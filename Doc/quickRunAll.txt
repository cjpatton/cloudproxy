Running all the tests
=====================

Make the directory structure on the main machine and the guest
machine.  I assume the device drivers are already in the kernel
and that all the non-Hv hosted OS's have been tbooted.  In addition,
I assume the tests are set up as specified elsewhere.

Copy all the executables to the Guest.

For the original fileProxy

1. Run sufpInit.sh as superuser

2. Reboot

3. Run sufpPrep.sh as superuser

4. Run runfp.sh


For the hosted fileProxy.

1. Run suInitHost.sh as superuser

2. Reboot

3. Run suHostPrep.sh as superuser
   This starts virt-manager and the VM.  Open the console
   to the VM quickly so you can cause the Grub menu to 
   appear and boot the right OS.

4. Run runguestfp.sh
