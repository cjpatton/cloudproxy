Tboot has to do the following before jumping into the evmm_main

	- Setup e820 tables

		* E820 table has range of address and types The table is part of
		vmm_memory_layout struct.  

		* Choose a e820 range to use, and use the
		start address of that slot as the base and perform relocations 

		* We need to block access to the memory that evmm uses from the guest(s).

		* Before vmlaunch, modify e820 to exclude evmm memory to be viewable by
		guest linux

	- Setup the stack for evmm; not sure of the exact expected size, but 16
	  pages should be enough.

	- Setup the heap for evmm; not sure of the exact expected size.

	- Tboot has to create initial page tables to enter ievmm in protected mode.		We could have simple flat/identity map page table structure.
